**LaTeX style file for thesis proposals**

This directory contains a latex style that was designed to help students
prepare MSc and PhD proposals for the Department of Oceanography at Dalhousie
University. It has since been extended to be less Dalhousie-specific, and to
include Honours thesis proposals also.

The main purpose is to save students a bit of time that might otherwise be
spent learning how to format a bibliography or deciding what elements they
might want to include in the document. (For example, the style sheet suggests
providing keywords and listing members of the examination committee.) As always
with latex, the goal is to encourage the author to think about content, not
appearance.

If you are on a unix machine, simply typing *make* in a terminal should create
a file *myproposal.pdf*. If you're on another type of machine, or if you have a
different workflow, just adjust things accordingly.

The thing most likely to give a problem is the inclusion of figures. If you use
pdflatex, you'll probably want to use *pdf* figures.  Different versions of
latex handle the inclusion of graphics files differently. Some systems are
clever enough to use a variety of graphics files, without changing the tex
file; all of this is beyond the present scope however.  The present example
uses *pdflatex* and so the *includegraphics* line refers to a PDF file. To help
you in your experimentation, this directory contains a figure in two formats,
*figure1p.pdf* and *figure1e.eps*.

After you have, ahem, figured out figures, you'll find it easy to do the rest.
Just edit *myproposal.tex* and start filling in information where suggested,
e.g. changing the string *(insert author name here)* to your name.

Some options are available, and these are indicated in the sample file. In
particular, please note the first 3 lines of that file.  The first will set the
line spacing to 1.37, which the author thinks looks quite good. If you want
single-spacing, comment out that line and remove the % character from line 2.
Or, if you want double-spacing, comment out line 1 and remove the % from line
3.

Please note that this is an early version of the file, and so there are lots of
possibilities for improvement. Please report problems and suggestions using the
issues tab of the github website
(https://github.com/dankelley/thesis_proposal/issues).  Those with good github
skills may wish to contribute improvements either by contacting the author by
email or by issuing a pull request on the github website
(https://github.com/dankelley/thesis_proposal/pulls).

**Configuration**

Read the comments in `myproposal.tex` to learn about things that you ought to
set, e.g. alter the line
```latex
\logofile{logo-eagle}
```
to name another university logo, or delete the content between the braces, to
prevent the drawing of a logo. Since logo sizes vary greatly, you will likely also
want to edit the line that reads
```latx
\logoscale{0.8}
```

**Installation**

If you want to use the `thesis_proposal` package like any regular LaTeX package without
copying the provided style sheets into the directory of your document, you may
install the package in a root path of your TeX distribution. The procedure
depends on the operating system, and so some steps listed below are divided
into Linux and MacOS (formerly OSX) variants; a procedure on Windows may be
added if a user explains it to the developers.

*Step 1: set up directories*

Open a terminal and type
```
kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFHOME
```

to find the root path of your TeX distribution. On linux and unix-like systems,
this is typically `/home/<username>/texmf`, where `<username>` is the name of
your user account on your computer. On MacOS (or the previous OSX) this will be
`/Users/<username>/Library/texmf`.  It is possible that this directory (and
necessary subdirectories) does not exist. In this case use the terminal and
create the requisite subdirectories, with
```
mkdir -p ~/texmf/tex/latex
mkdir -p ~/texmf/bibtex/bst
```
on Linux or
```
mkdir -p ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex
mkdir -p ~/Library/texmf/bibtex/bst
```
on MacOS.


*Step 2: clone the Dalhousie thesis repository*

At this stage, you are set up for doing work with Latex, and you will not need
to repeat these steps for any later updates to the Dalhousie thesis style sheet.

The next step is to clone the `thesis_proposal` repository. In the terminal, type
```
cd ~/texmf/tex/latex
git clone https://github.com/dankelley/thesis_proposal.git thesis_proposal
```
on Linux, or 
```
cd ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex
git clone https://github.com/dankelley/thesis_proposal.git thesis_proposal
```
on MacOS.

Finally, set up the bibliography style sheet, with
```
cd ~/texmf/bibtex/bst
ln -s ../../tex/latex/thesis_proposal/thesis_proposal.bst .
```
on Linux or
```
cd ~/Library/texmf/bibtex/bst
ln -s ../../tex/latex/thesis_proposal/thesis_proposal.bst .
```
on MacOS.


*Step 3. testing the setup*

You can test if your TeX distribution is able to find the class file and style
sheets by typing in the terminal:
```
kpsewhich thesis_proposal.cls
kpsewhich thesis_proposal.bst
```
and verifying that both commands report the full path to the respective files,
as you've set them up.

*Updating the installation*

If `thesis_proposal` gets updated, you may update your installation by doing
```
cd ~/texmf/tex/latex/thesis_proposal
```
on Linux or
```
cd ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex/thesis_proposal
```
on MacOS, and then typing
```
git pull
```
